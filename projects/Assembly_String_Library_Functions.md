Used assembly code to write a string library. Provided string commands: count of characters, count of vowels, uppercase first letters, uppercase all letters, and remove extra spaces. 
It promted the user to input a String and saved it to registers. It manulated characters one at a time either by changing them or getting rid of strings.
