<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/Assembly words.jpg">

Used assembly code to write a string library. Provided string commands: count of characters, count of vowels, uppercase first letters, uppercase all letters, and remove extra spaces. It prompted the user to input a String and saved it to registers. It manipulates characters one at a time either by changing them or by deleting strings.

From doing this project I learned to be patient when coding, when working with assembly it is very easy to get frustrated with the code. One line of code in C takes many, many lines of code in assembly since you are manipulating memory and registers. I also learned how to check different types of data on the bit level and how to change the bits to what you want. I can transfer these skills to all programming projects because now I can think like the CPU and I understand how computer code is executed at the lowest level.
