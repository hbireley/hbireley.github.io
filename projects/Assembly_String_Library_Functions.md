Used assembly code to write a string library. Provided string commands: count of characters, count of vowels, uppercase first letters, uppercase all letters, and remove extra spaces. 
It promted the user to input a String and saved it to registers. It manulated characters one at a time either by changing them or getting rid of strings.

From doing this project I learned to be patient when coding because when working with assembly it is very easy to get frustrated with the code. I also learned how to check different types of data on the bit level and how to change the bits to what you want. I can transfer these skills to the jobs because now I try really hard to think like the CPU and not over think the small details.
