Utilizing assembly language, a string library was developed to provide several essential string operations, including character count, vowel count, capitalization of first letters, conversion to all uppercase, and removal of extra spaces. The program prompts the user for input, which is then stored in registers for manipulation. The manipulation occurs at the character level, enabling modifications such as character changes or string deletion.


This project imparted valuable lessons in patience and meticulousness when coding, particularly in the context of assembly language, where manipulation of memory and registers demands careful attention to detail. Unlike higher-level languages like C, where a single line of code can achieve complex operations, assembly language requires numerous lines to achieve similar functionality. This project also deepened my understanding of data manipulation at the bit level and honed my ability to conceptualize and execute code from the perspective of the CPU. These skills are transferable to a broad range of programming projects, as they enhance the ability to think critically about program execution and understand the intricacies of computer architecture.
