I worked on a database project where I used C++ to develop and integrate new features into an existing database program. The project required a deep understanding of the existing codebase, including analyzing and interpreting the functionality of pre-implemented methods. My primary task was to design and implement functions that efficiently queried and processed data within the database. This involved identifying and utilizing the appropriate pre-existing functions while ensuring that my implementations produced accurate and reliable outputs. Additionally, I documented the development process, detailing the logic behind my approach, the functions utilized, and their specific applications in achieving the desired functionality. The project challenged me to troubleshoot, optimize, and maintain high coding standards while enhancing the databaseâ€™s capabilities.
