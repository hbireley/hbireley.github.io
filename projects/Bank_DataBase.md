<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/vacay/bank.png">

Used C and C++ to write a bank database and user interface including add, delete, find, and print all functions. It allows the user to determine how many record entries the database has. It uses dynamic memory allocation to make a linked list of data as the database. It has a user interface where the user can choose a menu option.

From doing this project I learned how to manipulate pointers in C and C++ to make a singly linked list. I also learned the importance of the order that you check your conditions in if statements when working with pointers. It is good to not jump right into coding when you get a problem, you need to try to figure out the steps you will take to get to the solution of the problem first.
