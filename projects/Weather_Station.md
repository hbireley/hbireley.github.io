Using Raspberry Pi sensors, weather data was recorded and stored in a cloud-based database. The system computed averages, low and high temperatures using a combination of C and SQL. This data collection spanned three days and was designed to be accessible and usable by weather companies for analysis and forecasting purposes.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in database programming and interfacing with Raspberry Pi sensors. It demonstrated the versatility of the Raspberry Pi platform, showcasing its ability to handle sensor data and interact with cloud services. Additionally, it served as an introduction to database programming, highlighting the process of storing and manipulating data efficiently.

Through this project, I discovered the extensive capabilities of Raspberry Pi and gained practical skills in sensor interfacing and database programming. This newfound knowledge can be applied to various job roles, as many companies utilize databases for storing and analyzing data.
