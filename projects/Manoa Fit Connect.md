I collaborated with a team to develop a fitness app tailored for individuals seeking workout partners at the University of Hawaii Manoa. Leveraging Meteor and React, our app allows users to create profiles detailing their interests, fitness goals, experience levels, and availability, facilitating connections with fellow university members. Additionally, the app features an event notification system, showcasing gym events and attendance numbers, enhancing user engagement. Users can also track their fitness progress, providing valuable insights into their journey.

My primary responsibility was the implementation of the Progress Tracker Page, a feature enabling users to monitor their personal fitness records. This page presents personal records in a table format, allowing for easy editing and addition of new records. Moreover, the page includes a motivational quote section to inspire users. Using Bootstrap cards, the page elegantly displays workout details. Each user's personal records and workouts are stored in separate MongoDB collections, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval for display.

This project taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and project management. I learned the importance of respecting teammates' time and addressing any blockers they may encounter. We utilized issue-based project management to divide tasks efficiently, although some degree of trust and patience was still necessary. Additionally, I acquired practical skills in working with MongoDB collections, including data manipulation and display, and gained insights into equitable workload distribution among team members.
