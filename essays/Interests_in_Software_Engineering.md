I have an interest in software development and cyber security. I like to code, program and problem solve. I enjoy writing code and seeing what the computer does with it. Programming can get very hard when you get stuck on a problem. It takes a lot of time and effort to figure out what is wrong and how to fix it. It sometimes takes researching the problem and seeing if others have the same issue. You have to teach yourself all the new features and functions that the new languages have to offer. I just love the feeling when you finally figure out the problem and all that hard work pays off and is not wasted. 

## What I want to learn

I hope to learn how to make websites, get better at problem solving, and the time coding tests for job interviews. I think that websites are fascinating, and would like to know how they are coded and developed. I love learning about cyber security and all the ways to hack into programs and reverse engineer them to learn their source code without running them. I want to learn about penetration testing, how it is done, the methods to hack into a network, and  the ways to prevent it. I also want to know how hackers can take down websites and how to prevent them from doing that. With the rapid growth of AI I would like to learn how it could be integrated into security and protecting websites and networks.  

## Experience I Want to have

I hope to get internships in the tech field in either cyber security or software engineering. I would like to work for a big tech company like Apple, Google, Microsoft, or Akamai. I want to learn how to do penetration tests and may do it as a job. I want to prevent hackers from taking websites down and help companies with their website security.
