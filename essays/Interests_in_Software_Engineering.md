I have an interest in software development and cyber security. I like to code, program and problem solve. I enjoy writing code and seeing what the computer does with it even though at some time it can get hard and you get stuck with a problem. I just love the feeling of when you finally figure out the problem and all that hard work is paid off and not wasted. I love learning about cyber security and all the ways to hack into programs and reverse engineer them to learn their source code. I really want to learn about penetration testing and how it is done and maybe in the future do it as a career.

I hope to learn how to make websites, get better at problem solving, and the time coding test for job interviews. I think that websites are cool and I do not know much about them and how they are coded and developed. I also want to know how hackers can take down websites and how to prevent them from doing that. I think my problem solving is good but I can always improve. I am not that great in pressure situations and the timed coding question for a job interview is one of the important things to get a job and I want to get better at them.

I hope to get many internships in the tech field in either cyber security and software engineering. I would like to work for a big tech company like Apple, Google, or Microsoft. I want to meet more people that have similar interests as I do. I want to learn how to do penetration tests and many do it as a job. I want to prevent hackers from taking websites down and help companies with their website security.
