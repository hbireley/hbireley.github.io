Learning Javascript was an interesting experience because there are a lot of new things that Javascript has that other programming languages do not. On that note I can see that some of the things in javascript can be hard to debug some code or to see what a piece of code is doing. On the other hand some things in java script were nice to have and I would like them in other languages.

What I like about JavaScript

The thing I like in javascript is that there are more array functions and the function makes it easier to add data to an array. The other thing is printing out arrays is way easier in javascript then in other languages because in javascript it's just one line of code not using a loop and printing out one index at a time. I also like that in javascript you do not have to say what the data type of the variable is, you can just make a variable and put whatever you want in it. I think that this might make it hard  for some people to debug code or passing parameters to function because you might change the variable type and not realize it and with parameters the coder does not know what data type is being passed to the function. I think that this might make it hard for some people to debug code or passing parameters to function because you might change the variable type and not realize it and with parameters the coder does not know what data type is being passed to the function. I also like how easy it is to make an object that maps a keyword to another datatype without using a class. I really like that there are no pointers in javascript because it is sometimes hard to figure out what is being changed and what is not.

What I think about how we are learning it

I think this style of learning is good because it tests your knowledge in a technical and fun way that is very similar to a job interview assessment. I think the WODs are a good way to put some pressure on if you actually know the materials and can produce an answer to a question in a timely manner. The first two practice WODs were good and too difficult where it is not realizable to the point where it's not impossible to complete in the allocated time. I found the first two practice WODs to be pretty easy and got in the RX time for both of them but I can see how the WODs can get pretty hard and stressful.
