## The importants of asking Smart question

Have you ever had someone ask you a question that was so confusing and out there that you don’t even know what they're even asking. That is an example of a not smart question or a quest where you have to repeatedly ask the person what they are even asking. A better way of asking questions are the ones that are precise and to the point like smart questions. Smart questions are the ones where you know what the person is asking right away and you don’t have to ponder on what they are asking. As a result of a good smart question it is much easier to form a good answer right away. In academia it is very easy to ask not smart questions because the teacher or professor is paid to answer your question and that is their job to help you learn. As you transfer into the real world, people are not paid to help you or are not willing to help you. So the best chance to get help is to go to forum sites like stackoverflow and ask precise questions that professionals can easily answer and not those where they have to really think about what the person is asking.      

## Smart Question

Stackoverflow is home to a lot of developers that are stuck and need to ask questions hoping for someone to answer them. In my time of writing code and testing my programs I have come across a lot of different questions that were smart. For example this question about adding columns to a data frame that can identify changed rows. The person was using python and got stuck trying to add a column for duplicate rows in his data frame. I liked that he precisely explained what he was trying to do in a clear and understandable way so that anyone could attempt to answer the questions. The person also included lines of code that were not right and the results he was getting. I think that is a great way to get a good answer fast and reliably. When asking questions about coding or writing programs it is a good idea to put some lines of code where you think the problem is at. It is really easy to make a dumb mistake and while coding it is very important to have the right ordering and syntax.

##Not so Smart question

While searching through Stackoverflow you will find a lot of people asking very vague and confusing questions or not so smart questions. For example I came across this question that was not really a question just this person wanting advice on html to remove span tags on his output. His question was phrased poorly and when reading the first time I had a hard time understanding what he wanted to do. I did like that he had an example of the output that he wanted with some code there. Even though he had an example I can see how people can see if you put little effort in forming and asking a question then except no to answer or a poor answer. Many people of the community agreed with me in saying that the question was not a smart question with it receiving a -3 rating on StackOverFlow.

## Conclusion

Overall in my time of coding I have used stackoverflow many times when I am stuck coding. I have found that the more effort you put into your question in forming them and asking them you have a better chance of getting answers. You should accept the amount of effort you put in you are going to receive. With that being said don’t be mad when no one answers your question when you do not put the effort in to make a good smart question.
