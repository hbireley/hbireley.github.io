## What are Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They represent best practices and provide a blueprint for how to solve certain design problems in a structured and efficient way. Design patterns are not specific to a particular programming language or technology; rather, they are abstract concepts that can be applied to various software development scenarios. 

There are several benefits to using design patterns. First and foremost, they help improve the efficiency of the development process by providing tested and proven solutions to common problems. This can lead to faster development times and fewer bugs in the final product. Additionally, design patterns can improve the maintainability of software systems by making the codebase more structured and easier to understand. This can be particularly useful in large, complex projects where keeping track of various components and their interactions can be challenging.

There are many different types of design patterns, each addressing a different aspect of software design. Some common categories of design patterns include creational patterns, which deal with object creation mechanisms; structural patterns, which deal with object composition and relationships; and behavioral patterns, which deal with the interaction between objects.

Overall, design patterns are an important tool in the software developer's toolkit. They provide a way to efficiently solve common design problems and improve the quality and maintainability of software systems. By understanding and applying design patterns, developers can create more robust, flexible, and maintainable software solutions.

## What Design Patterns I used 
The design patterns I used are the observer, model view controller, and Singleton. The observer pattern helped me establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing them to update automatically when the state of one object changes. This was particularly useful in ensuring that different parts of my application stayed in sync without tightly coupling them. The model view controller (MVC) pattern helped me separate the concerns of my application into three components: the model, which represented the data and business logic; the view, which handled the user interface; and the controller, which managed user input. This separation of concerns made my code more modular and easier to maintain. Finally, the Singleton pattern ensured that there was only one instance of a class, which was beneficial in managing shared resources and ensuring consistency throughout my application.
